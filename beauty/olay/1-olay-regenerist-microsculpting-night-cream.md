ingredients_summary: This cream is formulated with hydrating agents like Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Panthenol to deeply moisturize the skin. Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) improves skin tone and texture, while Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4 and Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract support anti-aging and antioxidant benefits. Dimethicone and Cyclopentasiloxane provide a smooth, silky texture and help retain moisture.

The formula also contains stabilizers and preservatives like DMDM Hydantoin, Disodium EDTA, and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate to ensure shelf-life and safety.
ingredients_quality: This formula combines high-quality hydrating agents like Glycerin and Sodium Hyaluronate to provide deep and lasting moisture. It features clinically proven Niacinamide to improve skin tone and texture, along with anti-aging peptides such as Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4 that support collagen production and firmness. Natural antioxidants from Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) and Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) extracts help protect skin from environmental damage. Silicone-based emollients like Dimethicone and Cyclopentasiloxane ensure smooth application and hydration retention, while soothing ingredients like Panthenol and Allantoin reduce irritation. Preservatives and stabilizers maintain product safety and shelf life, though those with very sensitive skin may want to patch-test due to some preservative content.
