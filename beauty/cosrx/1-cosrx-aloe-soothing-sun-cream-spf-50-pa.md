review: "After testing the COSRX Aloe Soothing Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA+++, we found it to be a hydrating sunscreen that offers broad-spectrum protection while delivering a dewy finish. Infused with aloe vera extract, it soothes and moisturizes the skin, making it suitable for dry and combination skin types. The lightweight texture absorbs easily without leaving a white cast, and its non-greasy formula sits well under makeup. However, some users with oily or sensitive skin have reported that it can feel heavy, cause pilling, or lead to breakouts, possibly due to its fragrance and rich consistency. It's not water-resistant, so reapplication is necessary during prolonged sun exposure or sweating. For optimal results, apply generously 30 minutes before sun exposure and reapply every two hours. Overall, this sunscreen is a good option for those seeking hydration and sun protection, but individuals with oily or sensitive skin should patch test first or consider alternative products."
