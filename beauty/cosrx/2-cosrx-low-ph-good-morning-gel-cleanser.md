review: "After testing the COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser, we found it to be a gentle yet effective option for maintaining the skin's natural balance. Formulated with a mildly acidic pH of approximately 5.3, it helps preserve the skin's protective barrier, making it suitable for daily use. Key ingredients like tea tree oil and betaine salicylate provide soothing and exfoliating benefits, aiding in the removal of impurities without causing irritation. The gel texture lathers lightly and rinses off easily, leaving the skin feeling clean and refreshed without a tight or dry sensation. However, some users with sensitive skin have reported mild stinging or dryness, possibly due to the tea tree oil content. For optimal results, we recommend using this cleanser in the morning to remove overnight impurities and following up with a hydrating moisturizer. Overall, this cleanser is a solid choice for those seeking a balanced, low-pH formula to support healthy skin."
